He is best known for films such as ""Eraserhead"" (1977), ""Blue Velvet"" (1986) and ""Mulholland Drive"" (2001), often regarded by critics as among the best films of their respective decades, and for his successful 1990–91 television series ""Twin Peaks"", which led to him being labeled ""the first popular Surrealist"" by noted film critic Pauline Kael. A recipient of an Academy Honorary Award in 2019, he has received three Academy Award nominations for Best Director, and has won France\'s César Award for Best Foreign Film twice, as well as the Palme d\'Or at the Cannes Film Festival and a Golden Lion award for lifetime achievement at the Venice Film Festival. He has been described by ""The Guardian"" as ""the most important director of this era"", while AllMovie called him ""the Renaissance man of modern American filmmaking"". Born to a middle-class family in Missoula, Montana, Lynch spent his childhood traveling around the United States before he studied painting at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts in Philadelphia, where he first made the transition to producing short films. He moved to Los Angeles, where he produced his first motion picture, the surrealist horror film ""Eraserhead"" (1977). After ""Eraserhead"" became a success on the midnight movie circuit, Lynch was employed to direct the biographical film ""The Elephant Man"" (1980), from which he gained mainstream success. He was then employed by the De Laurentiis Entertainment Group and proceeded to make two films: the science-fiction epic ""Dune"" (1984), which proved to be a critical and commercial failure, and then a neo-noir mystery film ""Blue Velvet"" (1986), which stirred controversy over its violence but later grew in critical reputation. Next, Lynch created his own television series with Mark Frost, the popular murder mystery entitled ""Twin Peaks"" (1990–1991). He also created a cinematic prequel,  (1992), a road film ""Wild at Heart"" (1990) and a family film ""The Straight Story"" (1999) in the same period. Turning further towards surrealist filmmaking, three of his subsequent films operated on dream logic non-linear narrative structures: ""Lost Highway"" (1997), ""Mulholland Drive"" (2001), and ""Inland Empire"" (2006). Meanwhile, Lynch embraced the Internet as a medium, producing several web-based shows, such as the animated ""DumbLand"" (2002) and the surreal sitcom ""Rabbits"" (2002). Lynch and Frost reunited for a third season of ""Twin Peaks"", airing in on Showtime in 2017. Lynch co-wrote and directed every episode, as well as reprising his role as Gordon Cole. Lynch\'s other artistic endeavours include: his work as a musician, encompassing three studio albums—""BlueBOB"" (2001), ""Crazy Clown Time"" (2011) and ""The Big Dream"" ( 2013)—as well as music and sound design for a variety of his films; painting and photography; writing three books—""Images"" (1994), ""Catching the Big Fish"" (2006), and ""Room to Dream"" (2018); and directing several music videos and advertisements, including the Dior promotional film ""Lady Blue Shanghai"" (2006). An avid practitioner of Transcendental Meditation (TM), Lynch founded the David Lynch Foundation in 2005, which sought to fund the teaching of TM in schools and has since widened its scope to other at-risk populations, including the homeless, veterans and refugees. In 2019, he received an Academy Honorary Award; his first Oscar win.\n\nRonnie Rocket\nRonnie Rocket is an unfinished film project written by David Lynch, who also intended to direct it. Begun after the success of Lynch\'s 1977 film ""EraserheadRonnie Rocket"" was shelved after Lynch felt he would be unable to find financial backing for the project. He instead sought out an existing script on which to base his next film, settling on what would become 1980\'s ""The Elephant Man"". ""Ronnie Rocket"" was to feature many of the elements which have since come to be seen as Lynch\'s hallmarks; including industrial art direction, 1950s popular culture and physical deformity. The script featured a three-foot tall man with control over electricity; Lynch first met Michael J. Anderson when tentatively casting for this role, and later cast him in ""Twin Peaks"" and ""Mulholland Drive"" as a result.\n\nIan Barry (director)\nIan Barry is an Australian director of film and TV.\n\nPeter Levin\nPeter Levin is an American director of film, television and theatre.'}","The director of film Ronnie Rocket is David Lynch.

La Trémoille was a French soldier and president of the States of Brittany. He joined the military at a young age and became a colonel of the Champagne regiment at the age of eighteen. Later, he became governor of Île-de-France. He distinguished himself in the battle of Guastalla, in Italy, and was named shortly thereafter sergeant of the armies of the king. La Trémoille was the author of some works and was elected a member of the Académie française on 13 February 1738. On 29 January 1725 he married his cousin Marie Hortense de La Tour d\'Auvergne, the daughter of Marie Armande Victoire de la Trémoïlle (1677–1717) and Emmanuel-Théodose de La Tour d\'Auvergne, duc de Bouillon (1668–1730). Marie Hortense, like her husband was a granddaughter of Charles Belgique Hollande de La Trémoille. From this union was born a son: Jean Bretagne Charles de La Trémoille and a daughter who died in infancy.\n\nCharles Bretagne Marie de La Trémoille\nPrince Charles Bretagne Marie de La Trémoille (24 March 1764 – 10 November 1839), 8th Duke of Thouars, 7th Duke of La Trémoïlle, 10th prince de Tarente, 14th prince de Talmond and 14th Count of Laval, was a French aristocrat and soldier; he was the son of Jean Bretagne Charles de La Trémoille and his wife Princess Marie-Maximilienne of Salm-Kyrburg.\n\nHenri Charles de La Trémoille\nHenri Charles de La Trémoille( 17 December 1620 – 14 September 1672) was a French military commander. He the son of Henry de La Trémoille, duc of Thouars and of La Trémoille, and his wife, Marie de La Tour d\'Auvergne. In 1628, La Trémoille\'s father, Henri III of Trémoïlle, converted himself and his children to Catholicism, but La Trémoille\'s mother convinced him to reconvert to Protestantism when he reached the age of majority. In 1638, he joined the army of his uncle, Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange. In 1648, he married the Calvinist Émilie of Hesse- Kassel, the daughter of William V of Hesse- Kassel( or Hesse- Cassel). They had five children, including Charles Belgique, his heir, and Charlotte Amélie de la Trémoille. In October 1651, during the Fronde, he came out against Cardinal Mazarin and supported Condé openly. As a result, in 1656 he was imprisoned in Amiens. La Trémoille\'s mother obtained his release after several months of imprisonment. He was then relegated in Poitou then turned over to serve in Holland. In 1668, he returned from Holland to manage the affairs of the duchy of Thouars, his father being weakened by the gout, and he again re-converted to Catholicism, taking away the children from his wife who fled to the Netherlands. He died two years before his father in 1672; it was thus his elder son, Charles, who succeeded as the fourth duke of Thouars.\n\nClaude de La Trémoille\nClaude de La Trémoille, 2nd Duke of Thouars (1566 – 25 October 1604) was a sixteenth-century French nobleman of the La Tremoille family. He was the son of Louis III de La Trémoille and his wife, Jeanne de Montmorency. King Henry IV of France had been friendly with La Trémoille when he was King of Navarre, but kept him in a subordinate position once he became King of France, preferring La Trémoille\'s cousin, Henry de La Tour d\'Auvergne, the Viscount of Turenne. In 1587, La Trémoille converted to Protestantism. He fought for Henry IV at the battle of Coutras and also at Ivry, and was rewarded by elevation to the peerage, as Duke of Thouars, in 1595. This new title, however, made La Trémoille lose more money than it earned him. In 1598, Turenne proposed to his sister-in-law Charlotte-Brabantine to marry La Trémoille. Thanks to her relations with the houses of Orange and Bouillon, Charlotte-Brabantine played an important part in the French Protestant diplomacy. They had four children: Henry; Charlotte, who married James Stanley, Earl of Derby; Élisabeth (1601–1604); and Frédéric (1602–1642) comte de Laval. In 1602, Charlotte-Brabantine dissuaded her husband from engaging in the conspiracy of Biron and encouraged him to lend allegiance to the king.
